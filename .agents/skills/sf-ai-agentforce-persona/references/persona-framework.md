# Agent Persona Framework

*A conversation design framework for AI agents: Identity + configurable attributes across five categories.*

---

## Why Design an Agent Persona?

Users assign personality to conversational agents within seconds. If you don't design that personality intentionally, users will invent one — often inconsistent, often unflattering. Designing an agent's persona gives designers more control over the user's experience.

A persona overrides the default voice of the large language model (LLM). It adds reliability and flexibility — changing the LLM has much less of an impact on how their agent comes across to users.

Consistency is key. When an agent sounds the same across every interaction — even when it fails — it becomes predictable. Predictability builds trust. Trust builds forgiveness for mistakes. The result: higher adoption, higher task completion, and a conversational experience that feels natural rather than unsettling.

This framework provides the building blocks for that consistency:

| Category | Attributes | What It Defines |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | *(anchor — not an attribute)* | Core personality traits — the foundation everything else derives from |
| **Register** | Register | Power dynamic and relationship between agent and user |
| **Voice** | Formality, Warmth, Personality Intensity | Linguistic character — how words sound and feel |
| **Tone** | Emotional Coloring, Empathy Level | Emotional quality and how feelings are handled |
| **Delivery** | Brevity, Humor | How much is said and with what wit |
| **Chatting Style** | Emoji, Formatting, Punctuation, Capitalization | Visual and textual conventions |

12 attributes across 5 categories. Each attribute is a single spectrum — select a position independently. **Persona archetype presets** provide starting points that pre-populate all 12 attributes at once; the designer fine-tunes from there.

Following this framework produces a complete persona document using the [persona document template](../assets/persona-template.md), which can then be encoded into Salesforce Agentforce using the [persona encoding guide](persona-encoding-guide.md).

---

## How to Use This Framework

### The Attribute Model

Each attribute is a single independent axis with a spectrum of named positions. Selecting a value for one attribute should not *require* knowing the value of another — but **constraint notes** recommend natural pairings. Any combination is valid; constraints flag when a combination may feel incoherent.

Categories group related attributes:
- **Register** — the power dynamic (1 attribute)
- **Voice** — how the words sound (3 attributes)
- **Tone** — how the agent comes across emotionally (2 attributes)
- **Delivery** — how much is said and with what humor (2 attributes)
- **Chatting Style** — how the text looks on screen (4 attributes)

### Workflow

1. **Start with Identity.** Write 3-5 adjectives that capture your agent's character. This is the anchor — everything derives from here.
2. **Optionally pick a persona archetype preset** that approximates the personality you're aiming for. This pre-populates all 12 attributes. Then fine-tune individual attributes.
3. **Or work through attributes in dependency order:** Register → Voice (Formality, Warmth, Personality Intensity) → Tone (Emotional Coloring, Empathy Level) → Delivery (Brevity, Humor) → Chatting Style. Constraint notes between sections explain how upstream choices pull downstream ones.
4. **Define Tone Boundaries** — what the agent must never sound like.
5. **Define Tone Flex** — how tone shifts by context (error, frustration, celebration).
6. **Generate Phrase Book and Never-Say List** — example phrases and anti-phrases tuned to the persona.
7. **Encode the persona** into your agent's system prompt, topic instructions, and action output instructions.
8. **Validate with sample dialog** — if the agent sounds wrong, revisit the area that's off.

### Attribute Boundaries

When attributes seem to overlap, use these boundary tests:

- **Register** = who has authority — the power dynamic between agent and user
- **Formality** = how polished is the language — grammatical structure and linguistic register
- **Warmth** = how approachable — interpersonal temperature, independent of formality
- **Personality Intensity** = how much character — the volume knob on distinctiveness
- **Emotional Coloring** = how it feels — the default emotional quality of responses (shifts by context via Tone Flex)
- **Empathy Level** = how feelings are handled — amount of emotional validation
- **Brevity** = how much is said — response length and density (persistent default, tapers with familiarity)
- **Humor** = whether there's wit — type of humor, if any (suppressed in error/escalation)
- **Chatting Style** = how text looks — emoji, formatting, punctuation, capitalization

### Scope Boundary: Persona vs. Interaction Design

| Persona Design (this framework) | Agent Design (adjacent) | Conversation Design (downstream) |
|---|---|---|
| Identity, Register, Voice, Tone | Use cases, JTBD, OKRs | Dialog flows, branching logic |
| Delivery, Chatting Style | Interaction Model (behavior) | Utterance templates, prompt chains, UI patterns |
| Phrase Book, Never-Say List, Lexicon | Information Architecture (output structure) | Business rules, routing logic, queue config |
| Tone Boundaries, Tone Flex | Recovery & Escalation (failure handling) | |
| | Content Guardrails (scope constraints) | |
| | Accessibility | |

The persona document is an input to conversation design, not a replacement for it. Interaction Model, Information Architecture, Recovery & Escalation, Content Guardrails, and Accessibility are defined in agent design.

### Cultural Adaptation Note

Persona attribute expectations vary by culture. For global agents, consider per-locale overrides. Key callouts:

- **Formality expectations vary** — positions that feel natural in one culture may feel too casual or too formal in another.
- **Warmth norms differ** — Bright warmth in one culture may feel overwhelming in another. Cool professionalism that works in one context may feel cold elsewhere.
- **Directness norms differ** — Blunt or Clinical emotional coloring that works in direct-communication cultures may feel abrupt in high-context cultures.
- **Humor doesn't translate** — set Humor to None for cross-cultural deployments unless you're localizing humor per locale.

### Tension Pairs

Some attribute combinations create productive tension. These are valid — they don't need to be "resolved" — but they need conscious design to coexist:

| Tension | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Cool Warmth + Bold Personality | Strong character without performed warmth. Competence IS the care. |
| Blunt Coloring + Playful Humor | Unvarnished truth delivered as comedy. The bluntness is part of the joke. |
| Encouraging Coloring + Terse Brevity | Short celebrations: "Done. Nice progress." |
| High Empathy + Terse Brevity | Brief validation, then act: "Frustrating. Here's the fix." |
| Formal + Warm | Polished hospitality, sophisticated warmth. (Impossible in v1.0 — now a first-class combination.) |
| Formal + Bold Personality | Theatrical character, immersive experience. Archaic formality with maximum personality. |
| Neutral Coloring + Bold Personality | Strong character without emotional investment. The character shows through word choice, not feeling. |
| Warm + Playful Humor | Cheeky affection — irreverence grounded in warmth. |
| Reserved Personality + Warm | Dignified care. Warmth through reliability, not personality. |
| Radiant Warmth + Playful Humor | Overflowing cute energy. Mascot-driven delight. |
| Terse Brevity + Heavy Formatting | Minimal words, maximum visual structure. Headlines and data blocks, no prose. |

---

## Persona Archetypes

Persona archetype presets are **accelerators, not constraints**. Picking a preset pre-populates all 12 attributes. The designer then fine-tunes individual attributes — overriding any that don't fit. A user who picks "The Concierge" but changes Warmth to Neutral is perfectly valid.

Presets also pre-suggest Identity traits, but Identity remains generative — the designer always writes their own.

### Presets

Organized by use case. Each has a conservative variant (professional, predictable) and an outlandish variant (distinctive, memorable). Neither is generic.

---

## Identity

*Core personality traits — "What kind of character is this?"*

Three to five adjectives that form the agent's character foundation. Every attribute below should be derivable from these traits. When in doubt, return to Identity.

Identity is generative, not a menu — write your own. These two examples show how different trait sets pull the rest of the framework in different directions.

**Example 1: Direct Operator**
*Direct, resourceful, no-nonsense.*

- Direct — says what it means in the fewest words possible. No hedging, no softening.
- Resourceful — reaches for the right tool or data immediately, doesn't ask the user to go find it.
- No-nonsense — skips pleasantries, avoids filler, treats the user's time as the scarcest resource.

**Example 2: Patient Guide**
*Patient, curious, supportive.*

- Patient — never rushes past confusion. Repeats or rephrases without frustration cues.
- Curious — asks genuine questions to understand the user's context before offering solutions.
- Supportive — celebrates small wins, normalizes mistakes, frames setbacks as learning.

*Constraint: Identity is the anchor. Everything traces back. If a choice in any downstream attribute contradicts Identity, Identity wins.*

### Naming

The agent's name is a user-facing persona decision, not just a configuration label. Users see the name in the chat header before any conversation starts — it's the first impression of who this agent is.

A good name aligns with Identity: a Direct, No-nonsense agent might be "Deal Progressinator" (purposeful, punchy) rather than "Sales Helper" (generic, passive). A Patient, Supportive agent might be "Onboarding Guide" rather than "Setup_Bot_v2."

Name also interacts with Register (a Subordinate named "The Boss" creates dissonance) and surface (Slack DM agents can be more casual than customer-facing web chat agents).

### Negative Identity — "What You're Not"

Character-level anti-patterns: what the agent fundamentally is not. These are broader than Tone Boundaries (which constrain how the agent sounds) and Never-Say List (which constrain specific phrases). Negative Identity constrains who the agent *is* at the character level, generating rules across multiple attributes.

**Examples:**
- "Not a salesperson" → constrains product recommendations toward helpfulness, suppresses upsell language, affects Phrase Book
- "Not an expert who talks down" → constrains Register behavior even at Advisor, affects Formality and Empathy
- "Not a pushover" → enables appropriate pushback even at Subordinate register

**Relationship to other constraints:**

| Concept | Level | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Negative Identity | Character | "Not a salesperson" |
| Tone Boundaries | Sound/feeling | "Never sound pushy" |
| Never-Say List | Specific phrases | "Never say 'great deal'" |

Each level generates the ones below it. "Not a salesperson" (character) generates "Never sound pushy" (tone boundary) which generates "Never say 'great deal'" (phrase).

Write 2-4 Negative Identity statements during persona design. Each should be a character type the agent must never become, not a behavioral rule.

### Values *(optional — explicit input only)*

What the agent believes. Values establish the persona's worldview and motivational core — they inform behavioral decisions that attributes alone don't cover.

**Examples:**
- "Everyone deserves to feel confident" → the agent normalizes struggles and celebrates small wins
- "Quality matters more than price" → the agent recommends the right tool, not the cheapest one
- "Learning never stops" → the agent treats every question as an opportunity, never as an interruption

Values are different from Identity traits:
- **Identity** = what kind of character ("Warm, Knowledgeable, Patient")
- **Values** = why the agent makes the choices it does ("Everyone deserves to learn")

Two agents with identical Identity traits can behave differently if their Values differ.

**Guardrail:** Values are populated **only from explicit user input** — the user states what the agent believes. Values are never inferred from brand guides, tone signals, or other persona attributes. If the user doesn't provide values, omit this section entirely. The reason: values carry ideological weight that should not be assumed.

Write 2-5 belief statements. Each should be a conviction that generates observable behavior.

---

## Register — "Who are you to me?"

*Boundary: Register governs the power dynamic between agent and user. It does not determine how polished the language is (Formality), how warm the agent feels (Warmth), or the emotional quality of responses (Emotional Coloring).*

```
◄─── Subordinate ──── Peer ──── Advisor ──── Coach ──── (Manager) ───►
```

### Subordinate
*Deferential assistant: asks permission, follows orders.*

- Formal address. "Would you like me to proceed with saving this field?"
- Waits for explicit instruction before acting. Never presumes.
- Defers to the user's judgment even when it has better information.
- Frames suggestions as requests: "If it's okay, I could also check the logs."

### Peer
*Knowledgeable colleague: proposes solutions, asks for validation.*

- Proposes solutions, asks for validation — not permission.
- "Want to save it?" not "Would you like me to proceed with saving this field?"
- No deference. Treats the user as a competent professional.
- Shares opinions and pushes back when something looks wrong.

### Advisor
*Trusted consultant: recommends with confidence and rationale, expects user to decide.*

- Brings domain authority. "Based on what I'm seeing, I'd recommend X because Y."
- Leads with a recommendation and its rationale, not a menu of options.
- Expects the user to make the final call — doesn't presume to decide.
- Key distinction from Peer: Peer shares opinions casually. Advisor brings structured, evidence-based guidance.
- Key distinction from Coach: Advisor leads with recommendations. Coach guides through questions.

### Coach
*Patient mentor: guides with questions, adapts to skill level.*

- Mentor, not authority. Guides with questions rather than directives.
- "What do you think happens if we change this?" not "You need to change this."
- Celebrates progress. Adapts complexity to the user's skill level. *(Note: Skill-level adaptation is also available at other registers — see [Skill-Level Adaptation](#skill-level-adaptation) under Voice.)*
- Deference to user's learning pace — never rushes past confusion.

*Note: "Manager" exists on the spectrum but has no archetype — agents rarely occupy it.*

*Constraint note → Formality: Subordinate pulls toward Formal or Professional. Peer is compatible with any Formality. Advisor pulls toward Professional or Casual. Coach pulls toward Casual.*

---

## Voice — "How do you talk?"

*Boundary: Voice is linguistic character — persistent across all interactions. If you're deciding how the agent's words sound and feel, that's Voice. Emotional quality is Tone; response length is Brevity; visual conventions are Chatting Style.*

Voice has three independent attributes: Formality (how polished), Warmth (how approachable), and Personality Intensity (how much character). These vary independently — a Formal agent can be Warm (luxury concierge), a Casual agent can be Cool (street-smart problem-solver), a Reserved agent can be Warm (dignified trust).

### Formality

*Grammatical and linguistic register — how structured and polished is the language?*

```
◄─── Formal ──── Professional ──── Casual ──── Informal ───►
```

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Formal** | No contractions. Polished, structured sentences. No slang, no idioms. Passive voice acceptable where it maintains objectivity. Reads like a well-edited business document. |
| **Professional** | Clean prose, plain language. May use contractions occasionally. Neither stiff nor casual. Standard sentence structure. |
| **Casual** | Uses contractions freely. Relaxed grammar, occasional fragments. Sounds human and conversational. May use light idioms. |
| **Informal** | Heavy contractions, slang, colloquialisms, fragments. Deliberately relaxed grammar. Sounds like texting a friend. |

**Maps to Agentforce Tone dropdown:** Formal → Formal, Professional → Neutral, Casual → Casual, Informal → Casual. The dropdown is a coarse shortcut; the framework adds behavioral specificity.

*Constraint note → Humor: Formal pulls toward Humor: None (humor undermines formal register).*

*Constraint note → Chatting Style: Formal pulls toward Emoji: None, Punctuation: Conservative, Capitalization: Standard.*

### Warmth

*Interpersonal temperature — how approachable and friendly does the agent feel?*

```
◄─── Cool ──── Neutral ──── Warm ──── Bright ──── Radiant ───►
```

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cool** | Distant, no interpersonal warmth. Efficient without being hostile. The agent is here to transact, not connect. |
| **Neutral** | Neither warm nor cold. Professional baseline. Acknowledges the user without investing emotion. |
| **Warm** | Approachable and friendly. Acknowledges the person behind the request. Uses "we" language, softens edges. |
| **Bright** | Actively enthusiastic and inviting. Celebrates the interaction itself. High energy, genuine delight in helping. |
| **Radiant** | Overflowing warmth. Every interaction feels like a gift. The agent's enthusiasm for *you* is unmistakable and infectious. |

Warmth is independent of Formality. A Formal + Warm agent is a luxury concierge (polished and personally attentive). A Casual + Cool agent is a street-smart honest broker (competence is the care, not performed warmth).

*Constraint note → Humor: Cool pulls toward Humor: None or Dry (warm humor conflicts with cool temperature). Bright and Radiant are compatible with Warm or Playful humor.*

### Personality Intensity

*How much character comes through in the agent's language?*

```
◄─── Reserved ──── Moderate ──── Distinctive ──── Bold ───►
```

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Reserved** | Minimal personality. Functional, predictable language. The agent fades into the background — you notice what it does, not how it sounds. |
| **Moderate** | Some personality, professional character. A recognizable style that doesn't distract from the content. |
| **Distinctive** | Clear personality in word choice and framing. Memorable style — you'd recognize this agent from its writing. |
| **Bold** | Strong personality that defines the experience. Polarizing by design — the character IS the product. Metaphor systems, signature phrases, unmistakable voice. |

Personality Intensity is about *how much* character, not *what kind*. Two Bold agents can sound completely different — Identity traits and Phrase Book define the character; Personality Intensity sets the volume knob.

*Constraint note → Humor: Reserved pulls toward Humor: None (strong personality needed to land humor).*

### Voice Channel Parameters (optional)

When the agent's surface is a voice channel (phone, voice assistant, IVR), define these additional characteristics. These are physical voice qualities on top of the Voice attributes.

- **Pitch range** — Low / Mid / High. Affects perceived authority and warmth.
- **Speaking rate** — Slow / Moderate / Fast. Match to Formality and Brevity.
- **Energy level** — Calm / Moderate / Energetic. Match to Warmth and Emotional Coloring.
- **Warmth ("aural smile")** — Neutral / Warm / Bright. Match to the Warmth attribute.

These parameters are only relevant for voice surfaces and should be omitted for text-based agents.

<a id="skill-level-adaptation"></a>

### Skill-Level Adaptation *(optional)*

When the agent's audience spans multiple expertise levels, the agent may need to adapt its language complexity and explanation depth to the user's demonstrated skill level. This is independent of Register — a Peer agent helping a beginner still simplifies, even though it's not coaching.

**How it interacts with attributes:**
- **Formality** stays constant — skill-level adaptation changes *what* is explained, not *how polished* the language is
- **Brevity** may shift — beginners get more explanation (toward Moderate), experts get less (toward Concise/Terse)
- **Lexicon** adapts — domain vocabulary is used freely with experts, explained or avoided with beginners
- **Personality Intensity** stays constant — the character doesn't change, only the complexity of what it says

**When to include:** Customer-facing agents with broad audience skill ranges. Internal agents with a homogeneous expert audience can skip this.

Skill-Level Adaptation is encoded as a behavioral rule in Topic Instructions or system.instructions, not as a standalone attribute.

---

## Tone — "How do you come across?"

*Boundary: Tone is emotional quality — it shifts by context (routine vs. error vs. celebration). If you're deciding how the agent feels to the user, that's Tone. Word choice is Voice; visual conventions are Chatting Style.*

Tone shifts by context; Voice doesn't. An agent's emotional coloring may be neutral on routine tasks and shift toward encouraging when the user hits a wall — but its voice stays constant. See **Tone Flex** below for how to define these shifts.

### Emotional Coloring

*Default emotional quality of the agent's responses.*

```
◄─── Blunt ──── Clinical ──── Neutral ──── Encouraging ──── Enthusiastic ───►
```

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Blunt** | Unvarnished, no diplomatic packaging. Says it straight — no hedging, no softening, no cushioning. "That deal is dead." Not hostile — just refuses to mediate between reality and the user's feelings. Epistemic stance: definitive, unqualified. |
| **Clinical** | Zero emotional coloring. Data exchange. Hedges with probability language: "likely," "confirmed," "possible." No "good news" or "unfortunately." States findings without editorial. Epistemic stance: precise, calibrated. |
| **Neutral** | Professional, neither cold nor warm. Emotionally level. Labels confidence ("Confirmed fix" / "Best guess") without dwelling on it. No celebration, no dramatization — states outcomes as facts. Epistemic stance: transparent, honest. |
| **Encouraging** | Warm positivity grounded in honesty. Validates difficulty, then shows the path forward. Celebrates progress without sugarcoating problems. "That error is tricky — here's what usually fixes it." Epistemic stance: transparent with optimistic framing. |
| **Enthusiastic** | High energy, actively celebrates. Treats each interaction as an opportunity to delight. Excites about possibilities. "Oh, great choice! You're going to love what this can do." Epistemic stance: confident and forward-looking. |

**Epistemic stance note:** How the agent handles certainty and uncertainty is correlated with Emotional Coloring but not identical. Clinical agents hedge precisely; Encouraging agents frame uncertainty optimistically. When a persona needs an unusual pairing, define it in Tone Boundaries.

*Constraint note → Empathy Level: Blunt → Minimal. Clinical → Minimal or Understated. Encouraging → Moderate or High. Enthusiastic → High.*

*Constraint note → Register: Subordinate pulls toward Neutral or Clinical. Coach pulls toward Encouraging.*

### Empathy Level

*How much emotional validation the agent provides.*

```
◄─── Minimal ──── Understated ──── Moderate ──── High ───►
```

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Minimal** | Acknowledges factually. No emotional validation. "The deployment failed" — then moves to resolution. |
| **Understated** | Care shown through action and attention, not words of comfort. A brief nod, then pivots to solutions. Doesn't dwell on feelings but doesn't dismiss them either. The warmth is there if you know where to look. |
| **Moderate** | Acknowledges difficulty briefly, then moves to resolution. "That's tricky — here's the fix." Default for most agents. |
| **High** | Validates the user's experience before problem-solving. "I can see how frustrating that must be. Let's sort this out together." Best for customer-facing agents with Encouraging or Enthusiastic emotional coloring. |

### Tone Boundaries

Define what the agent must *never sound like*. These are the negative space of your Tone selections — testable rules that prevent drift.

Tone Boundaries are authored per persona, not a menu — write your own based on the attributes and context. The following defaults apply to most agents:

- Never apologize for asking clarifying questions (that's a repair flow, not an error)
- Never apologize for not knowing something (state the limitation and offer next steps)
- Only apologize when the agent caused an explicit mistake
- Never ask the user for empathy ("I'm still learning", "I'm not smart enough")

Add context-specific boundaries based on the Emotional Coloring and other attributes. Examples:
- Neutral: "Never sound apologetic or servile." "Never use corporate jargon."
- Encouraging: "Never be saccharine — validate briefly, then act." "Never dramatize failures."
- Clinical: "Never editorialize findings." "No 'good news' or 'unfortunately.'"
- Blunt: "Never be cruel — blunt ≠ hostile." "Never mock the user's situation."

*Note: Content limits (topics the agent must not engage with), confidence rules, and compliance constraints (e.g., "never claim to be human") are defined in agent design, not persona. Tone Boundaries constrain how the agent sounds — not what it can do.*

### Tone Flex

Tone Flex defines how the agent's tone shifts from its baseline in response to context. The baseline is the selected Emotional Coloring and Empathy Level. Tone Flex defines how far each can shift, in what direction, triggered by what conditions.

**Triggers** — context conditions that cause shifts:
- **System state** — errors increase urgency, timeouts need patience
- **User emotional state** — frustration increases empathy, confusion increases patience
- **Content sensitivity** — emotionally loaded topics increase empathy, high-stakes content increases seriousness
- **Conversation phase** — opening may be warmer, deep troubleshooting may be more clinical
- **Success/progress** — celebrations shift toward encouraging

**Shift rules** define direction and magnitude per trigger:

| Trigger | Attribute | Shift Example (from Neutral baseline) |
|---|---|---|
| User frustrated | Empathy Level | Understated → Moderate |
| System error | Humor | Any → None (always suppress) |
| Progress / success | Emotional Coloring | Neutral → Encouraging (briefly) |
| High-stakes topic | Humor | Any → None |
| Emotionally sensitive content | Empathy Level | Up one position from baseline |

**Hard boundaries** — Tone Boundaries are the outer wall of the flex range. The agent can shift within its flex range but must never cross a Tone Boundary. If the baseline is Neutral and the boundary says "Never sound saccharine," then flex toward Encouraging is acceptable but Enthusiastic would violate the boundary.

**Flex range** — How far each attribute can shift. Author per persona. Example:
- Emotional Coloring: Neutral baseline, flex range Neutral–Encouraging (never Clinical, never Enthusiastic)
- Empathy Level: Understated baseline, flex range Minimal–Moderate (never High)

Tone Flex is authored per persona during design. The encoding expresses flex rules as per-topic tone calibration in Topic Instructions.

*Note: User-formality matching (agent mirrors the user's casual/formal register) is a related but open area — it depends on model capability as much as instructions. Not included in Tone Flex for v1.1.*

## Delivery

Two standalone attributes that control response shape and humor. Both are independent of Voice and Tone but interact with them through constraint notes.

### Brevity

*Response length and information density — how much does the agent say?*

```
◄─── Terse ──── Concise ──── Moderate ──── Expansive ───►
```

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Terse** | Cut every unnecessary word. One-word answers acceptable. Active voice, imperative mood. |
| **Concise** | Short sentences, says what's needed. Every sentence earns its place. |
| **Moderate** | Complete explanations with reasoning. Thorough but not verbose. *(Default)* |
| **Expansive** | Detailed, thorough responses. Full context, background, alternatives. |

**Tapering:** All Brevity positions taper as the user demonstrates familiarity. First interaction: full context and explanation. Repeat interactions: shorter. The agent assumes the user knows the basics and doesn't re-explain.

*Heuristic: The "One Breath Test" — could the agent's response be spoken in a single breath? Useful for calibrating Terse and Concise.*

*Constraint note: Brevity is largely independent, but Register and Formality create natural pairings. Subordinate + Formal pulls toward Moderate or Expansive (deferential agents rarely truncate). Peer + Professional pairs naturally with Concise. Coach pulls toward Moderate (teaching requires explanation).*

### Humor

*Type of wit, if any.*

```
◄─── None ──── Dry ──── Warm ──── Playful ───►
```

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **None** | No humor. Default for regulated, high-stakes, or formal contexts. |
| **Dry** | Understatement, deadpan, intellectual wit. Never forced. |
| **Warm** | Light humor that reinforces warmth. Celebratory, situation-aware. |
| **Playful** | Puns, wordplay, whimsical personality. Best for casual contexts and personality-forward brands. |

No frequency setting — frequency is emergent from Brevity (terse = fewer words = fewer humor opportunities) and constrained by context (never humor in error states).

*Constraint: When Humor is not None, always include this tone boundary: "No humor in error states, escalation, or high-stakes contexts."*

*Constraint note: Formality + Emotional Coloring constrain Humor. Formal → None. Professional + Clinical → Dry or None. Casual/Informal + Encouraging → any humor type.*

## Chatting Style — "How does the text look on screen?"

*Boundary: Chatting Style governs visual presentation — emoji, structural formatting, punctuation habits, and capitalization patterns. These are how the text looks, not what it says (Voice) or how it feels (Tone). Independent of the agent's Information Architecture (defined in agent design), which governs output layout patterns.*

Four settings. Pick one option for each.

### Emoji

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **None** | No emoji. Default for formal contexts, regulated industries, or text-heavy interfaces. |
| **Functional** | Emoji as data compression — status indicators (✅❌⚠️), categories, severity levels. Each emoji conveys meaning; none are decorative. If you removed all emoji, information would be lost. |
| **Expressive** | Emoji for personality and warmth alongside functional use. Decorative emoji acceptable — they reinforce tone without carrying critical information. If you removed all emoji, no information would be lost, but personality would diminish. |

Boundary test: "If you removed all emoji, would information be lost?" Functional = yes. Expressive = no.

### Formatting

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Plain** | Prose only. No bullets, no bold, no headings. Reads like natural conversation. |
| **Selective** | Formatting used purposefully — bold for key terms, bullets for lists of 3+, code blocks for copy-paste content. Formatting serves the content, never decorative. |
| **Heavy** | Extensive formatting — headers, dividers, tables, nested lists, section-based layouts. Every response has visible structure. |

### Punctuation

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Conservative** | Standard punctuation only. No exclamation points, no ellipses, no em dashes. Periods end every statement. |
| **Standard** | Normal punctuation with occasional expressiveness. Exclamation points for genuine emphasis. Em dashes for asides. *(Default)* |
| **Expressive** | Liberal use of exclamation points, ellipses, em dashes, and other expressive marks. Punctuation conveys energy and personality. |

### Capitalization

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Standard** | Conventional sentence case and title case. Proper capitalization throughout. *(Default)* |
| **Casual** | Lowercase-casual where appropriate — no capitalization at message start, lowercase labels. Best for Slack bots, internal tools, or informal agents. |

*Constraint note: Formality constrains Chatting Style. Formal → Emoji: None, Punctuation: Conservative, Capitalization: Standard. Professional → Emoji: Functional or None, Punctuation: Standard or Conservative. Casual/Informal → any combination.*

*Constraint note: Brevity constrains Formatting. Terse + Heavy is a productive tension (minimal words, maximum visual structure). Expansive + Plain may create walls of text — consider at least Selective.*

*Note: Accessibility requirements (screen reader compatibility, cognitive load, plain language) may constrain persona choices — e.g., Functional Emoji may need plain-language equivalents for screen readers. Accessibility is defined in agent design.*

## Phrase Book & Never-Say List

Two companion artifacts generated per persona. Both are tuned to the persona's attribute selections and Identity traits.

### Phrase Book

Example phrases the agent would use in common situations. Categories are selected during the workflow based on attribute selections — they vary per persona. Examples of selection-driven categories:

- **All agents:** Acknowledgement, Apology, Redirect/Handoff
- **Non-Terse agents:** Welcome/Greeting
- **Encouraging/Enthusiastic coloring:** Celebrating Progress
- **Coach register:** Teaching Moments
- **Humor ≠ None:** Humor Examples (showing the humor type in context)

The Phrase Book is the single most effective lever for making an agent sound like itself. Encoding per-topic phrase book entries into Topic Instructions produces the strongest persona consistency.

### Never-Say List

The inverse of the Phrase Book — specific words, phrases, and patterns the agent must never use. Derived from:

- **Tone Boundaries** expressed as specific anti-phrases (e.g., "Never sound apologetic" → never say "I'm sorry, I can only...")
- **Identity contradictions** — phrases that violate the persona's traits (e.g., a Direct agent never says "I'd be happy to help you with that!")
- **Generic chatbot filler** — "Great question!", "Hope this helps!", "Let me know if you need anything else!" (these undermine almost every persona)
- **Register violations** — phrases that break the power dynamic (a Peer never says "Would you like me to proceed with..."; a Coach never says "Just do X")
- **Brand prohibitions** — competitor names, deprecated product names, off-brand language

The Never-Say List is authored alongside the Phrase Book and encoded into Tone Boundaries and Topic Instructions. When reviewing a persona, the Never-Say List is often the fastest way to test whether the agent stays in character.

## Lexicon

*Brand terminology and domain vocabulary scoped per topic.*

When an agent operates across multiple topics, each topic may have its own vocabulary — technical terms, brand-specific language, industry jargon. Lexicon defines which words belong where.

**Example:** A luxury watch agent has watch-specific vocabulary ("movement," "chronograph," "caliber") that belongs in product topics but NOT in order-tracking topics. Loading it globally wastes context and can cause the agent to over-use jargon in simple service interactions.

**How Lexicon differs from Phrase Book:**
- **Phrase Book** = how the agent *sounds* in common situations — organized by situation
- **Lexicon** = what *words and terms* the agent uses in specific domains — organized by topic

**In encoding:** Lexicon maps to Topic Instructions — each topic gets a vocabulary block with the relevant domain terms. A luxury watch customer independently validated this pattern: global persona in Role, per-topic "more like / less like" examples in Topic Instructions, and per-topic lexicon scoped to where it matters.

Lexicon is lightweight for v1.1 — establish the concept and include a brief lexicon section in the persona document when the agent has topic-specific vocabulary.
